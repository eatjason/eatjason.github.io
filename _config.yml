about_me_description: <p>I believe that one of the most important tasks in a society is making sure education is passed down in such a way that goes beyond indoctrination and empowers the next generation to explore new horizons without dismantling the benefits of tradition.  I have had several interests as my career has progressed, but my primary interest is research and experimentation.  This interest began when I was young, as I had an AppleIIe to play with when I was only two years old.  I had a strong interest in video games growing up, and started studying computer science and video game architecture in high school before there were any official classes to teach them.  I was part of the first group of kids to get to be in a computer science class that was started by our geometry teacher.  I continued to study video game architecture through college, but lost interest in video games in general after having the opportunity to study various world religions in college.</p><p>I decided to acquire a masterâ€™s so that I could teach college level courses, and switched my studies from low level coding used in video game development to web application development.  I have worked several years doing web development, but prefer the coding that I used to do when I was younger.  I hoped to start teaching computer science, but there was a lack of openings at schools with real computer science programs.  Fortunately, web coding has started to go back to more low level languages to allow web applications to scale to large numbers of users, which has made my previous skills relevant again.  At the University of Michigan we had to take many courses on how to write low level software from scratch, I hope to teach in this way in the future as schools tend to have students learn countless frameworks without learning the foundations of computer science.</p><p>Many of my jobs were acquired through my original video game development experience, but would rather apply these skills to something less entertainment related.  Most recently I have been interested in video game design again, and did some contract netcode work for small companies in Michigan.  I have a personal company which someday I hope to release a small multiplayer game on the net.  Currently my work is in developing a networking engine that I can apply to a large set of retro style games.  I have a lot of experience working with people from different cultures.  At the University of Michigan I have worked with nearly every ethnic background.  After college I spent time traveling to many Indian temples, and also met people practicing the same faith as me from many backgrounds.  I have visited both India and Thailand, Thailand being my most favorite country in the world.</p>
